# Assal Enterprise Data

Use this gem to access Assal Enterprise Data.

Right now it only reads from a database source. The source can be specified
by the app that is using it (for example, a sqlite DB or a mysql DB).

By segmentating this code out we disconnect our apps from the particulars
of Assal. This gem should only expose general interfaces to the public.

# Usage

Coming soon!

# Testing

To run tests use 'bundle exec rspec' in the root directory.
